# AWS Troubleshooting: gptpat.com DNS Configuration

## Objective
Configured `gptpat.com` in Route 53 for WorkMail, resolving DNS issues post-GoDaddy transfer.

## Challenges
- **Nameserver Mismatch**: Fixed misalignment between registered domain and hosted zone.
- **Regional Conflicts**: Updated records from `us-west-2` to `us-east-1`.
- **CNAME Apex Error**: Mitigated `InvalidChangeBatch 400` error.

## Resolution
- Synchronized nameservers: `ns-318.awsdns-39.com`, etc.
- Updated records: MX, CNAME, TXT (e.g., `"5X05kWuT9X/Zk/uL7GD/uivTy1XX1ZiYj70S3KmqRQo="`).
- Added SPF/DMARC for security.

## Results
- WorkMail operational in ~2-3 hours; 10 tasks completed.
- Skills: Route 53, WorkMail, DNS diagnostics.

3.5.25 | AWS Troubleshooting Case Study: Configuring gptpat.com with Route 53 and WorkMail
Objective
Successfully configured the domain gptpat.com in AWS Route 53 to support Amazon WorkMail after a transfer from GoDaddy, resolving multiple DNS-related issues while maintaining functionality with Amazon Lightsail. Demonstrated expertise in DNS management, AWS service integration, and error resolution within a production environment.
Environment
AWS Services: Route 53, WorkMail (us-east-1), Lightsail
Domain: gptpat.com
Timeline: March 05, 2025
Duration: ~2-3 hours active troubleshooting + propagation wait
Challenges Identified
Nameserver Misalignment:
Registered domain nameservers (ns-1060.awsdns-04.org, etc.) diverged from hosted zone (ns-318.awsdns-39.com, etc.), disrupting DNS authority.
Regional DNS Conflicts:
Existing records pointed to WorkMail in us-west-2 (e.g., inbound-smtp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com), conflicting with us-east-1 requirements.
CNAME Apex Violation:
Encountered InvalidChangeBatch 400 error due to an attempted CNAME at the apex (gptpat.com), violating DNS standards.
Record Misplacement:
TXT record for domain ownership (_amazonses) was incorrectly set at the apex instead of the subdomain.
Outdated DKIM Records:
Existing DKIM CNAMEs mismatched WorkMail’s required values, hindering email security.
Resolution Strategy
Nameserver Synchronization:
Analyzed and updated registered domain nameservers in Route 53 to match the hosted zone, ensuring authoritative control.
Command-line validation: nslookup -type=NS gptpat.com.
Conflict Resolution:
Identified discrepancies using WorkMail’s DNS requirements; updated MX (10 inbound-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com) and CNAME (autodiscover.mail.us-east-1.awsapps.com) records to align with us-east-1.
Removed us-west-2 references to eliminate regional conflicts.
CNAME Apex Mitigation:
Diagnosed the error source as a WorkMail automation glitch; manually configured subdomains (e.g., autodiscover.gptpat.com) to avoid apex CNAME restrictions.
Ensured apex compatibility with A/ALIAS records if needed for Lightsail.
Record Correction:
Relocated the _amazonses TXT record ("5X05kWuT9X/Zk/uL7GD/uivTy1XX1ZiYj70S3KmqRQo=") to its proper subdomain, adhering to SES verification protocols.
Validated TXT formatting with quotes per DNS best practices.
DKIM and Security Enhancement:
Replaced outdated DKIM records with WorkMail-specified CNAMEs (e.g., afjw4svf63l77fpgth5y4mrbvnl7bhya.dkim.amazonses.com).
Added SPF ("v=spf1 include:amazonses.com ~all") and DMARC ("v=DMARC1;p=quarantine;pct=100;fo=1") TXT records for robust email security.
Verification and Testing:
Leveraged WorkMail’s "Update all in Route 53" feature post-correction, achieving a "configured correctly" status.
Conducted DNS propagation tests: nslookup -type=MX gptpat.com, nslookup -type=CNAME autodiscover.gptpat.com.
Results
Outcome: Fully operational WorkMail setup for gptpat.com in us-east-1, with all DNS records (MX, TXT, CNAME) validated and pending propagation.
Tasks Completed: 10 (nameserver update, record edits, error resolution, verification).
Skills Demonstrated:
Advanced Route 53 DNS management (nameservers, record types, propagation).
WorkMail integration and SES configuration.
Error handling (CNAME apex, regional conflicts).
Command-line diagnostics and AWS console proficiency.
Key Takeaways
Precision in DNS configuration is critical for AWS service interoperability.
Proactive conflict resolution and manual overrides enhance automation reliability.
Regional alignment is essential for seamless service operation.
